# Churn prediction

## General info
The project concerns churn prediction in the bank customers. Based on data we have tried to predict whether the client is going to leave the bank or not by using information like credit score, tenure, salary, etc. Project includes data analysis, data preparation and created model by using different machine learning algorithms such Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Ada Boost and XGBoost.

### Dataset
The dataset contains the details of the customers in a bank company such as credit score, estimated salary, age, sex, etc. It comes from Kaggle and can be find 
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/shubh0799/churn-modelling).

## Motivation
The aim of the project were churn prediction in the bank customers. Churn is a term that means losing customers to the competition. A “Churned” customer is one who has cancelled their service and identification of such users beforehand can be invaluable from the company's point of view. It is very important because retain customers who want to leave us is in many cases much cheaper than acquiring new ones. In our analysis we have used different machine learning classifiers to predicted whether the client is going to leave the bank or not.
